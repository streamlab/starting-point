This isn't just a class. This is a huge group project.

## Teams

To learn and accomplish things in this huge project, we'll divide into teams. You are absolutely welcome to participate and contribute to any team -- but you are responsible  for the obligations of your team. No team will work in isolation, all teams will have a lot of interaction with each other.

After the first class, we'll ask you to give me your top three choices for what team you'll be on. The teaching team will try to match you to your wishes, though obviously that might not be possible. Just remember that you can participate in any team's discussions or activities, but you are responsible for work on the team you're assigned.

###  Story Team
You will find the sources, interview the sources, pull together story notes, find the parole affected,  write the final story. You will work on visuals that help tell the story, including graphs, photos, video. You will work with the sensor team to display he data, and with the water team to get the facts right.

### Water Team
You become experts about  the experts, get their opinions, get their insights and try to figure out how best to use the sensors we have. You are our lead researchers on the science front. You will pass along their knowledge to the story team and the sensor team, and help interpret the data from the sensors.

### Document Team
You will Document The Process, establishing a website, taking pictures, taking notes, and then really spelling it out. People coming to the site should have a great sense of where we are, what we've learned, how we've succeeded and failed.

### Sensor Team
You will get to know the sensors well, figure out how they work and don't work, learn how to calibrate them, prototype the deployment, lead the actual deployment  and collect the data. You will be the keepers of that data -- which means you are also key to making sure anyone else on the team or in the world can get, use and understand  that data.

## Presentations

Obviously, not every person can be on every team, so to keep everyone fully involved teams will present their current findings. These should be thoughtful and instructive. They aren't just lists of what happened. Lead the discussion. Teach the others what you know so they can use it, too. Some things you can/should present:

* A demo or slide show about your learnings
* A presentation on the best discovery you've had
* A discussion of your concerns and roadblocks
* Highlighrs of your interviews, experiments, research

Focus on the things we need to know!

In addition ...

* All presentations must solicit and welcome feedback from your peers
* Peers, you must participate with cogent questions, insights, elaborations, good info.
* You will be judged poorly if you are boring. Don't be boring.

## Slack

Slack is a collaboration chat system broken up into a bunch of rooms, or channels. It is what the top newsrooms and news-innovation teams are using these days, and it's pretty awesome.

Slack is what we'll use to communicate and collaborate. This is especially important since John will be remote for so many classes.

Slack works in your browser, or as a phone or desktop app. The easiest way to get to our slack is:

- [http://streamlab.slack.com](http://streamlab.slack.com)

We have the following channels, which everyone has access to:

* #general - project-related  issues for all
* #water - team water
* #sensors - team sensors
* #story - team story
* #document - team document
* #random - unrelated shareable randomness
* #ice-cream - because it is great

Bedfore the first class, you will need to register for our Slack. Watch for an invitation email!

Please make sure to set up a profile with your full name. Please be sure to use an actual photo of you as your icon. It's going to be hard to match faces with names from afar, and this will help John a ton. The Slackbot will help you do some of this, and you can click on your name in the upper left to manage your profile.

## No Email

We're not using email for this class. Use Slack.

Okay, not zero email; you will still get official university emails. But please don't use it to communicate about the content of the project. If what you need to say needs to stay private, use the direct-message feature.

Also, Slack will tell you (via email) if you're missing out on something.
