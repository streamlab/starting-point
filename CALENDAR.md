### Assignment for August 24: Finding a Story
  - Working in small groups of twos or threes, everyone picks a possible focus area from Emily's list. One or two groups might be chose to find a story not on the list
  - Each group should be prepared to make a presentation of at least 5 minutes next class that addresses:
    - What's the body of water (please show it on a map).
    - What's the issue at hand?
    - How might pollutants change over time or over distance?
    - Who are some of the people who know the issue best?
    - Who are some of the people affected by this?
    - Where would you imagine placing the sensors?
  - Together in your group, write one paragraph summarizing the location and features and another paragraph summarizing your key points from your presentation. Have one person in your group post it in the #water channel on Slack.
  
## August 24

### Instructors 
  - Dana, Dave, Emily (John away and offline)
  
### Hour 1 - Guest Speaker Ken Ward
  - Ken Ward, a longtime environmental reporter with the Charleston Gazette, is one of our media partners and will talk about water quality issues in WV and how to best cover stories on this topic.

  - Where might this story appear
  - Who's our audience

### Hour 3 - Team Lab Time

Teams will be announced at the start of this class. 

#### Water Team
- Working from the presentations last hour, conduct further research where we might conduct our sensor project -- and actually pick your top recommendation and one alternate. Look specifically at issues that may show changes in turbidity over time or over distance in October. Collaborate with Story Team on this.

#### Story Team
- Working with the Water Team, research the issues, industries and possibly affected people in the areas we are considering. Make a list of the people you would like to interview, and feel free to reach out to some of them for background discussions during class or later in the week.

#### Sensor Team
- Get to know the Riffle. Look into the background online, and the motivations for building it. Figure out how it works and give it a try.  Learn how to get data off of it. Be prepared to demonstrate for the class.

#### Document Team
- Establish and pick a layout for a blog that can take posts from all of your team members and is good for showing photos, blog posts and other content. Be sure there is some fixed area where we can link out to other project pages (such as for data) and also our collaborators and partners.
- Make an introductory post for the project, and then additional posts that list/show the areas under consideration.


  
### Assignment for August 31: Each Team Presents
  - Each team -- Water, Story, Sensor and Document -- presents findings so far
  - Review the presentations section of the [TEAM-DETAILS](https://github.com/streamlab/starting-point/blob/master/TEAM-DETAILS.md) document for specifics. 
  - Remember: Be informative, don't be boring.
  - Prepare to welcome questions and to discuss next steps with the entire class.
  - You may need to meet as a team in person or in Slack before the next class
  - Feel free to consult with your instructors over Slack. This is new and we're all finding our way.
